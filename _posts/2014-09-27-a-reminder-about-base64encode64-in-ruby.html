<p>Some days ago I was in a integration with a third-party service, so I ended up making use of an HTTP authorization header.</p>

<p>As normal, I needed to pass username and password base64-encoded in the format "username:password".</p>

<p>The first thing on my mind was to use <code>Base64#encode64</code> from Ruby's standard library as usual (see the snippet below).</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'base64'

Base64.encode64('myusername:mysuperpassword')
{% endhighlight %}

<p>However, I could not authenticate, I just received the following error message "':' is missing".</p>

<p>Not for the first time, after a while dealing with this particular issue, I found out the reason. As very <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/base64/rdoc/Base64.html#method-i-encode64" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">well documented</a>, <code>encode64</code> adds a <code>\n</code> to every 60 encoded chars in the output string.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'base64'

Base64.encode64('a')           # => "YQ==\n"
Base64.encode64('a') == "YQ==" # => false
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As solution, we could use <code>Base64#strict_encode64</code> or keep <code>Base64#encode64</code> and then replace <code>\n</code> occurrences. See below:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'base64'

Base64.strict_encode64('a')           # => "YQ=="
Base64.strict_encode64('a') == "YQ==" # => true
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'base64'

Base64.encode64('a')                          # => "YQ==\n"
Base64.encode64('a').gsub("\n", '') == "YQ==" # => true
{% endhighlight %}

<p>But the first approach is faster (2x at least on avg):</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
puts Benchmark.measure { 5000.times{ Base64.strict_encode64('a')  } }

0.010000   0.000000   0.010000 (  0.009167)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
puts Benchmark.measure { 5000.times{ Base64.encode64('a').gsub("\n", '')  } }

0.020000   0.000000   0.020000 (  0.024225)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I hope don't forget it anymore.</p>

<p>See you.</p>
