<p>Hi, today I am here to share with you a way to parse natural language with Ruby, using <a href="https://github.com/cjheath/treetop" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">treetop</a> gem.</p>

<h2>Why Do I Need it?</h2>

<p>Imagine we need that a user from our application input some rule or condition to solve a problem. We could use a traditional field like <code>[type="text"]</code> to get it, no?!</p>

<p>But, what if this input is so complex (too many logical/comparison operators for instance) that you would need a lot of them to pull it off?</p>

<p>I came across with this situation a time ago, so, the better solution I found, was to use natural language to let users input rules using their own mother language.</p>

<h2>Hands-on</h2>

<p>Treetop let us define the syntax that is going to be parsed, so then, we need to create a <code>treetop</code> file with desired rules.</p>

<p>Let's suppose we need to take some action just if the result of the following rule were true: "if number of orders is greater than X" (X is an integer number).</p>

<p>Below, we can see a <code>treetop</code> file describing the above statement.</p>

{% highlight text %}
# my_grammar.treetop
grammar MyGrammar
  rule root
    if space number_of_orders space greater_than space value
  end

  rule if
    "if"
  end

  rule number_of_orders
    "number of orders is"
  end

  rule space
    [\s]+
  end

  rule greater_than
    "greater than" <GreaterThanOperator>
  end

  rule value
    [0-9]+ <Value>
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Ok, we have the syntax set, now we need to parse and evaluate the statement.</p>

<p>Our system does not know how to interpret the assertion, we need to help.. Let's create a file to put some assistance.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
# node_extensions.rb
module MyGrammar
  class GreaterThanOperator < Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode
    def text_value
      ">"
    end
  end

  class Value < Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code>text_value</code> method from each class inheriting from <code>Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode</code> represents the value to be returned when parsing some statement, so here, we say to return <code>></code> always that the parser find the snippet <code>greater than</code> (that is linked to the <code>GreaterThanOperator</code> in <code>treetop</code> file).</p>

<p>Once the class does not override the <code>text_value</code> method, it will return the same value contained into assertion, but, to get the return, we need to create the class, as we did with <code>Value</code> class.</p>

<p>Ok, now our system already knows how to deal with the statement, let's parse it:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
# parser.rb
require "treetop"

BASE_PATH = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))
require File.join(BASE_PATH, "node_extensions.rb")

class Parser
  Treetop.load(File.join(BASE_PATH, "my_grammar.treetop"))

  def self.go statement, number_of_orders
    parser = MyGrammarParser.new
    
    tree = parser.parse(statement) 
    if !tree.nil?
      tree = clean_tree(tree)
    end
    rule = tree.inject(number_of_orders.to_s) do |final, current|
      final += current.text_value
    end
    puts rule
    eval rule
  end

  def self.clean_tree(root_node)
    return if(root_node.elements.nil?)
    root_node.elements.delete_if{|node| node.class.name == "Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode" }
    root_node.elements.each {|node| self.clean_tree(node) }
  end
end

assertion = Parser.go "if number of orders is greater than 20", 50
puts assertion
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here we call the parser passing the statement with the already known number of orders and clean the tree (as written in <a href="http://thingsaaronmade.com/blog/a-quick-intro-to-writing-a-parser-using-treetop.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">this post</a>).</p>

<p>We iterate over the extracted values from our assertion, create a valid Ruby statement and then evaluate it with the <code>eval</code> method.</p>

<p>This is a simple example, but we can make use of more complex rules to parse any statement.</p>
