<p>You are building a mobile application with <a href="http://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Ionic Framework</a> using <code>ionic serve</code> to test it in a browser, most likely, you will need to store some data.</p>

<p>We can store in a SQLite database, however, your application will not work in a browser, because they dont support it.</p>

<p>So you think in making use of local storage to pull it off. But we all know that it's just a key/value storage, and we need to store relational data.</p>

 <p>I came across this situation last week and the best approach I found was to use the great <a href="https://github.com/agershun/alasql" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">AlaSQL</a> library to reach my goal.</p>

<p>This JavaScript library allows us to perform querys like that:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
alasql("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category_id = ?", [1]);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Yeah! It's SQL in browser my friend. They support many kinds of storage like localStorage, indexedDB, text files (JSON, CSV) etc.</p>

<p>In my <code>www/js/app.js</code> file I placed the database bootstrap like below:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
alasql('CREATE localStorage DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db');
alasql('ATTACH localStorage DATABASE db');
alasql('USE db');

alasql("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (id INT, category_id INT, name string, created_at DATE)");
alasql("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS categories (id INT, name string)");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then we can manipulate some data in controllers:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var id         = $scope.id;
var categoryId = $scope.categoryId;

alasql("INSERT INTO products (id, category_id, name, created_at) VALUES (?,?,?,?)", [parseInt(id), parseInt(categoryId), 'XYZ', new Date()]);

alasql("SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ?", [parseInt($state.params.id)]);

alasql("SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY created_at DESC");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>See that we are using <code>parseInt()</code> to ensure that int fields will receive a proper value. You can have problems like I had if dont care about it.</p>

<p>That is all, see you.</p>
