<p>Let's suppose you have some code like that in a view:</p>

{% highlight haml %}
= @user.editable_field_for 'birth_date', field_class: 'datepicker' do |value|
  = value.try(:strftime, '%d/%m/%Y')
{% endhighlight %}

<code>editable_field_for</code> is a method inside a decorator and you need to evaluate the given block.

<p>How would you write this method? That was my first try:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
def editable_field_for field_name, options = {}, &block
  capture_haml do
    haml_tag :span, class: 'inline-editable' do
      haml_concat block.call(self.send(field_name))
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Call the block passing field's value as argument, seems obvious? But it does not work.</p>

<p>After some hard time I found the solution:</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def editable_field_for field_name, options = {}, &block
  capture_haml do
    haml_tag :span, class: 'inline-editable' do
      haml_concat capture_haml(field_value, &block)
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>We need to capture the block (line 4) using <code>capture_haml</code> to get it as string, then, we concatenate into the buffer.</p>

<p>In this example I am passing <code>field_value</code> as argument to the block (and receiving it as <code>value</code> in the view), but you can remove it if you don't need.</p>

<p>Note we are using <code>capture_haml</code> in two different ways, with and without a block. Before this issue, I just knew the first one, as explained in <a href="{% post_url 2013-11-18-usando-helpers-do-haml %}" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">this post</a> (in portuguese only).</p>

<p>That is it.</p>
