<p>I know, this post is a bit odd comparing to what I am used to write.</p>

<p>You (developer) are doing your job, when your boss turn to you and say:</p>

<p>- "Hey, let's make a robot to automate the payment routine?!".</p>

<p>- "Ok, what do you need?"</p>

<p>- "It needs to access the bank website, sign in and schedule some payment transactions".</p>

<p>- "Ok, let me try"</p>

<p>Some could think in making use of Selenium to pull it off, but here are some caveats:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The financial pc runs Windows (the one used to run the robot)</li>
    <li>The bank website uses a Java applet and requires a USB token to sign in</li>
</ul>

<p>Selenium didn't seem to be the best option for me.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>I was fortunate enough to remember I was told about <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com" rel="_external nofollow" target="_blank">AutoIt</a> sometime ago, "a scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting".</p>

<p>I had committed myself to play with it someday and this robot seemed a good opportunity.</p>

<p>Most of the code I will show below was taken from internet and adapted for my needs.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Head to AutoIt website, click Downloads and download the version "AutoIt Full Installation".</p>

<p>Open the SciTE editor and we are ready to develop. Hit F5 to run the program.</p>

<h3>GUI</h3>

<p>I created a simple GUI which contains an input text to enter the date to schedule the payments and a button responsible for calling the "goPay" function.</p>

{% highlight cmake %}
#include <AutoItConstants.au3>
#include <GUIConstantsEx.au3>

Opt("GUIOnEventMode", 1) ; Change to OnEvent mode

Func KeepUI()
   ; Create a GUI with various controls
   Local $hGUI = GUICreate("Payments", 300, 120)

   GUISetOnEvent($GUI_EVENT_CLOSE, "CLOSEButton")

   ; Create the label
   GUICtrlCreateLabel("Schedule payment for (ex: 29/10/2017):", 20, 20)
   ; Create the input text
   Global $transferDateInput = GUICtrlCreateInput("", 20, 38, 230, 20)

   ; Create the button
   Local $goBtn = GUICtrlCreateButton("Pay", 20, 70, 85, 25)
   GUICtrlSetOnEvent($goBtn, "goPay")

   ; Display the GUI
   GUISetState(@SW_SHOW, $hGUI)

   While 1
    Sleep(100) ; Sleep to reduce CPU usage
   WEnd

   ; Delete the previous GUI and all controls.
   GUIDelete($hGUI)
EndFunc

KeepUI()

Func CLOSEButton()
    Exit
EndFunc

Func goPay()
EndFunc
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Reading and validating the input</h3>

<p>In the first lines of "goPay" I read and validate the input:</p>

{% highlight cmake %}
; Get the filled value
Global $transferDate = GUICtrlRead($transferDateInput)

If $transferDate == "" Then
  MsgBox($MB_SYSTEMMODAL, "Warning", "Fill the payment date")
  Return
EndIf
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If the date is empty, I display a pop up and return.</p>

<h3>Creating a browser instance</h3>

<p>AutoIt has built-in support for the Internet Explorer browser, it's not the best, but does the job.</p>

{% highlight cmake %}

; Create the IE instance
Local $oIE = _IECreate("https://mybank.com/sign_in")
; Maximize active window
WinSetState("[ACTIVE]", "", @SW_MAXIMIZE)
; Wait opening the site and loading the Java applet
Sleep(5500)

; Type the password and ENTER
Send("1234567489{ENTER}")

Sleep(5000)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In my case, if the pc has the USB token connected, we don't need to type user/password, just the token password.</p>

<p>Notice we use <code>{}</code> to type the "ENTER" key. You can see others commands <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/appendix/SendKeys.htm" rel="_external nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Reading and iterating over a CSV file</h3>

<p>We need to read the payments destination from somewhere, a CSV file seems good:</p>

{% highlight cmake %}

Global $CSVFILE = "C:\Users\User\Documents\list.csv"
; The delimiter in the CSV file
Global $DELIM = ";"
Global $i, $arrContent, $arrLine, $res = 0

$res = _FileReadToArray($CSVFILE, $arrContent)
If $res = 1 Then
  For $i = 1 To $arrContent[0]
    $arrLine = StringSplit($arrContent[$i], $DELIM)
    If IsArray($arrLine) And $arrLine[0]<>0 Then
      ; Prints the array
      _ArrayDisplay($arrLine)

      ; Do something with the elements of the line

      ; Display the bank branch
      ; & @CRLF returns a \n
      ConsoleWrite(StringFormat("bank branch %s", $arrLine[1]) & @CRLF)
    Else
      MsgBox(48, "", "Error splitting line!")
    EndIf
  Next
Else
  MsgBox(48, "", "Error opening file!")
EndIf
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Navigating through the links</h3>

<p>All the links in the bank website I was accessing were handled by JavaScript code, so I had to navigate using mouse movements and clicks.</p>

{% highlight cmake %}
; Move mouse pointer to the coordinates X, Y
MouseMove(650, 480)
MouseClick($MOUSE_CLICK_LEFT)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is what we need to make the robot, don't forget to close the IE instance in the end:</p>

{% highlight cmake %}
_IEQuit($oIE)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Using the <code>Aut2Exe</code> (comes in the full installation) we can export the script into a standalone .exe file that does not require runtime libraries.</p>

<p>See you.</p>
